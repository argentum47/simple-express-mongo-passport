Sample express mongo passport setup

I have read and seen a few stuff and then I have come up with
an approach to kindof setup a clean nodejs express application.

The main inspration was to split up the dependencies away from the main server/app .js file
and still then load the dependencies in a particular order.

Mongoose has also given me a hard tym, so this kindof simplifies all of the steps
